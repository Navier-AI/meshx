# Assets

The following is an attempt

 - `cloth_argus.obj` file was taken from the [`argus`](https://github.com/lijieumn/argus-distribution) project, and so is
   licensed under [Argus' licenses](https://github.com/lijieumn/argus-distribution/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
 - `sphere_coarse.msh` was taken from [`mshio`](https://github.com/w1th0utnam3/mshio) and is
   licensed under the MIT license.

All other files were either created manually, with `meshx` or with Kitware's
[ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/).
